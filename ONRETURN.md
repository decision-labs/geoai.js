# ON RETURN - Work Progress Tracker

## Last Session: December 19, 2024 at 3:30 PM
- **Date:** December 19, 2024
- **Branch:** add-tms-support
- **Context:** Working on TMS (Tile Map Service) provider implementation and testing

## Current Status
- [x] TMS provider implementation completed in `src/data_providers/tms.ts`
- [x] TMS provider integrated into base model and type system
- [x] TMS configuration added to examples (`examples/next-geobase/src/config.ts`)
- [x] TMS tiles integrated into map components
- [x] Created comprehensive Makefile for development workflows
- [ ] **FAILING TEST**: TMS coordinate flipping issue in test `test/tms-provider-only.test.ts`
- [ ] Need to fix Y-coordinate calculation for TMS vs Web Mercator compatibility

## Notes
- **TMS Implementation**: Successfully implemented TMS provider with support for API keys, custom extensions, and headers
- **Coordinate System Issue**: TMS uses bottom-left origin while Web Mercator uses top-left - commented out Y-coordinate flipping but test still expects it
- **Test Failure**: `should handle TMS without API key` test expects Y=823 but gets Y=200 due to coordinate system mismatch
- **Configuration**: Updated TMS config to use OpenAerialMap instead of Sentinel Maps
- **Development Tools**: Added comprehensive Makefile with commands for install, build, test, docs, and examples

## Next Steps
1. **Fix TMS coordinate system test**: Decide whether to implement Y-coordinate flipping or update test expectations
2. **Run full test suite**: Ensure all TMS integration tests pass
3. **Test TMS provider in examples**: Verify TMS tiles load correctly in the Next.js example app
4. **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect TMS provider availability (remove "Coming Soon" status)
5. **Push changes**: Commit and push the working TMS implementation
