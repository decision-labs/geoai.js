# GeoAI: AI-Powered Geospatial Analysis in JavaScript

## Abstract

This talk covers GeoAI.js, a JavaScript library for running AI models on geospatial data in browsers and Node.js. We'll examine how to perform computer vision tasks like object detection, land classification, and image segmentation on satellite and aerial imagery.

## Relevance

Geospatial AI is rapidly growing across industries including agriculture, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and logistics. Companies are increasingly using satellite imagery and aerial data for automated analysis, but existing solutions often require specialized infrastructure or cloud services.

This session shows how to implement geospatial AI directly in JavaScript applications, reducing infrastructure costs and enabling real-time analysis. Attendees will learn practical implementation techniques, not just concepts - you'll see working code examples and understand how to integrate AI models into existing web applications.

The combination of AI and geospatial data represents a significant opportunity for JavaScript developers, as most current tools are Python-based. This talk bridges that gap.

The presentation includes:

- Running AI inference on geospatial imagery
- Chaining multiple AI tasks for complex workflows
- Integration with mapping providers (ESRI, Mapbox, Google Maps)
- Building web applications with AI capabilities
- Using Web Workers for background processing

We'll look at the library's architecture, supported AI models, and practical implementation examples.
